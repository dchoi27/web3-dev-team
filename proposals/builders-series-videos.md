Initial PR: https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/pull/73

<!--
This template is for a proposal/brief/pitch for a significant project to be undertaken by a Web3 Dev project team.
The goal of project proposals is to help us decide which work to take on, which things are more valuable than other things.
-->
<!--
A proposal should contain enough detail for others to understand how this project contributes to our team’s mission of product-market fit
for our unified stack of protocols, what is included in scope of the project, where to get started if a project team were to take this on,
and any other information relevant for prioritizing this project against others.
It does not need to describe the work in much detail. Most technical design and planning would take place after a proposal is adopted.
Good project scope aims for ~3-5 engineers for 1-3 months (though feel free to suggest larger-scoped projects anyway). 
Projects do not include regular day-to-day maintenance and improvement work, e.g. on testing, tooling, validation, code clarity, refactors for future capability, etc.

## Purpose &amp; impact 
#### Background &amp; intent
_Describe the desired state of the world after this project? Why does that matter?_
<!--
Outline the status quo, including any relevant context on the problem you’re seeing that this project should solve. Wherever possible, include pains or problems that you’ve seen users experience to help motivate why solving this problem works towards top-line objectives. 
-->

#### Assumptions &amp; hypotheses
_What must be true for this project to matter?_
<!--(bullet list)-->

#### User workflow example
_How would a developer or user use this new capability?_
<!--(short paragraph)-->

#### Impact
_How would this directly contribute to web3 dev stack product-market fit?_

#### Leverage
_How much would nailing this project improve our knowledge and ability to execute future projects?_

<!--
Explain the opportunity or leverage point for our subsequent velocity/impact (e.g. by speeding up development, enabling more contributors, etc)
-->

#### Confidence
_How sure are we that this impact would be realized? Label from [this scale](https://medium.com/@nimay/inside-product-introduction-to-feature-priority-using-ice-impact-confidence-ease-and-gist-5180434e5b15)_.

- **Impact = 9** (currently no high-level short videos available showcasing _possibilities_ of the tech; currently no videos on top of ipfs.io, nor specific illustrations of IPFS in action)
- **Confidence = 8** (user testing specifically revealed need for more high-level video content; also specifically flagged as hackathon need)
- **Ease = 6** (COVID presents some challenges, but work itself isn't difficult and is somewhat repeatable)


## Project definition
#### Brief plan of attack

<!--Briefly describe the milestones/steps/work needed for this project-->

#### What does done look like?
- Initial video is finished and published to ipfs.io, YouTube, and our social media channels
- Video is ready for presenting as appropriate to future hackathons
- Timelines for work on future videos has been determined and agreed upon (or a decision deferral date set)

####  What does success look like?
- Positive reception (likes, comments, reposts) on social media
- Positive reception in hackathons
- Click-through rate for "additional resources" offered in video end card
- Other collabs enthusiastically willing to be video subjects

<!--
Provide success criteria. These might include particular metrics, desired changes in the types of bug reports being filed, desired changes in qualitative user feedback (measured via surveys, etc), etc.
-->

#### Counterpoints &amp; pre-mortem
_Why might this project be lower impact than expected? How could this project fail to complete, or fail to be successful?_

- Not showcasing the highest-impact builders, builders that offer empathy/identification for potential builders, etc.
- Not creating enough videos for them to offer useful contrast and counterpoint as a set
- Not promoting adequately enough via social, hackathons, etc

#### Alternatives
_How might this project’s intent be realized in other ways (other than this project proposal)? What other potential solutions can address the same need?_

- Adding more case studies scratches a similar itch, but ignores those for whom video is a preferred learning method

#### Dependencies/prerequisites
None. _Note, however, that we won't get as thorough of watch metrics if we embed on existing ipfs.io site than we would on a replatformed, Countly-enabled ipfs.io as described in https://github.com/orgs/ipfs/projects/11._

#### Future opportunities
- An expanded series of videos - either just _more_ videos, or _more focused_ videos for audiences like "building NFTs", "building on Ethereum", etc
- Followup materials for each video — case studies, opportunities for hackathon tie-in talks from the builders, etc

## Required resources

#### Effort estimate
Shirt size: Medium/large (per video)

_Note that this proposal is for the first video in the series only; the intent is to re-propose for future videos once we have a little time to gauge initial video's performance._

#### Roles / skills needed
- Project lead/PM (Jessica Schilling): Coordinate tasks, manage schedule/dependencies, ensure adherence to spec, etc
- Video team (Zak Robinson, Nick Cucci): Cooordinate video shoot and production, edit, manage approval workflow
- Video graphics (TBD - may be outsourced): Create any static or motion graphics used in videos
- Site implementation (Zé Bateira): Add video(s) to ipfs.io, including any additional metrics events if site is replatformed by then
- Social media implementation (PL marketing team): Disperse via all appropriate social channels
