# Web3 Dev Team

This repo is the project management hub for PL's efforts contributing to the Web3 ecosystem through improvements to libp2p, IPFS, IPLD, Filecoin and other projects.

The primary planning mechanism is discussion of proposals for significant projects to be undertaken by PL-sponsored project teams. Check them out on the [projects board](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/projects/1). Pitch a new project by [filing an issue](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/issues/new/choose) using the project proposal template.

# Pipelines

There are two pipelines for triaging projects. The first is the "Project Pipeline" which is where all new proposals are reviewed and triaged. A project will either be closed, approved and assigned to a team, or it will be moved to the "Grant Pipeline."

Proposals are managed in a Project board with the following columns.

* Needs Review
* Needs Owner
* In Progres

As new proposals are created they are assigned reviewers. Once the required number of reviewers have approved the proposal it will automatically move from the "Needs Review" column to the "Needs Owner" column. Every Monday the project leads will review pending proposals and decide if they should be:

* Closed. Any proposal that is not something we can assign resources or grant/contract funding.
* Approved. The card on the project board will be moved to "In Progress" and the PR will be assigned to the Project Team Lead and Engineering Manager. When the project is finished the PR will be merged.
* Moved to the "Help Wanted"

Proposals in the "Help Wanted" pipeline need to be modified to include any associated funding and points of contact. The full Help Wanted approval process is TBD.
