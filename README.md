# Web3 Dev Team

This repo is the project management hub for PL's efforts contributing to the Web3 ecosystem through stewardship of libp2p, IPFS, IPLD, Filecoin and other projects.

The primary planning mechanism is discussion of proposals for significant projects to be undertaken by PL-sponsored project teams. Check them out on the [projects board](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/projects/1).
