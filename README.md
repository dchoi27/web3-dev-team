# Web3 Dev Team

This repo is the project management hub for PL's efforts contributing to the Web3 ecosystem through improvements to libp2p, IPFS, IPLD, Filecoin and other projects.

The primary planning mechanism is discussion of proposals for significant projects to be undertaken by PL-sponsored project teams. Check them out on the [projects board](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/projects/1). Pitch a new project by [filing an issue](https://github.com/protocol/web3-dev-team/issues/new/choose) using the project proposal template.

# Projects

Projects are 2-8 week chunks of work (though some projects may be larger in some cases, and you should feel free to suggest these anyways) that directly contribute to improving usability and adoption of the InterPlanetary dev stack of protocols (IPFS+IPLD+libp2p+Filecoin).

Project teams should aim to take on no more than 2 projects at once to encourage focus on landing work before picking up new responsibilities.

# Project Principles

- We donâ€™t know all the potential projects up front - create space to define and prioritize new project ideas as we go
- Optimize for leverage - choose projects that help us learn and target our work better over time
- Great ideas come from everywhere - make it fast to capture these ideas and evaluate for action
- Enable any contributor to scope & act on scoped projects (by forcing ourselves to write down what should happen and why)
- There are multiple ways to solve a problem - multiple projects can be scoped from a single idea
- When there are technical debates on how to execute on a project, keep discussion in the relevant protocol repo (ex _go-ipfs_) & synthesize updates/insights in the project proposal
- The best project proposals synthesize data/input/expertise from many sources (protocol stewards/PMs/leads/domain experts/etc)

# Pipelines

There are two overlapping pipelines for triaging projects. The first is the "Project Pipeline" which is where all new proposals are reviewed and triaged. A project will either be closed, approved and assigned to a team, or it will be moved to the "Grant Pipeline."

Proposals are managed in a Project board with the following columns.

* Needs Review
* Needs Owner
* In Progress
* Grants
* Completed

As new proposals are created they are assigned reviewers. Once the required number of reviewers have approved, the proposal it will automatically move from the "Needs Review" column to the "Needs Owner" column. Every Monday, the project leads will review pending proposals and decide if they should be:

* **Closed**. Any proposal that is not something we can assign resources or grant/contract funding.
* **Approved**. The card on the project board will be moved to "In Progress" and the PR will be assigned to the Project Team Lead and Engineering Manager. When the project is finished the PR will be merged.
* **Moved** to the "Grant Pipeline".

Proposals in the "Grant Pipeline" will be separately triaged / scoped / RFP'd and assigned eventual owners when a match is found.

# Project selection criteria

- Solves an urgent need or risk in the ecosystem/stack today (ex security risk)
- Increases our execution velocity, making subsequent work easier / faster / more impactful
- Unlocks leveraged ecosystem experimentation / contribution / impact through our stack
- Blocker for critical high-value user journeys (directly or indirectly)
- Confidence in this project improving our usability & adoption (supported by evidence)
- Ease to complete this project (eng weeks)
