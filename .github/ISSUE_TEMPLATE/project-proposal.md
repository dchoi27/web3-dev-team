Project proposals live as Markdown documents in this repo.
After drafting an initial proposal in a PR, file an issue with this template and link to the proposal
detail and PR discussion(s).

Project name: [insert name]
Proposal: [link to markdown file in this repo]
Initial PR: [reference PR number with the first proposal draft]
Problem Addressed: [reference a problem from `/problems.md` in this repo]

This issue is for project management of a proposal, deciding, scheduling etc. Discussion about the relative merits of the proposal is welcome here, but discussion about the content of the proposal is better in a PR to the proposal document.
